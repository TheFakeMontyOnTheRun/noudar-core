Monks
=====

Monks that kept the citadel and renewed the faith of the soldiers
tasked with dealing with possessed people all the time. There are
around 20 monks on the citadel.

Once they're defeated, they drop a token of faith to replenish
the player's faith.

They will not attack until being approached from very close.
Their attack is only punches, so not all that strong after all.
