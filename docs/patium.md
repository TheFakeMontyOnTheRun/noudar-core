Patium
======

The entrance to the citadel, with a small square and a broken statue. One side has the tower that overlooks the whole place, which also guards the cemetery, the other has the entranace to the chuch and then citadel walls.

The cemetery lies on a higher ground than the square. Nothing much going on here - it's kind of a training ground for the game.
