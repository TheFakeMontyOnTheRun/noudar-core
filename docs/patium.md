Patium
======

The entrance to the citadel, with a small square and a broken
statue. One side has the tower that overlooks the whole 
place, which also guards the [cemetery](cemetery.md), the 
other has the entrance to the [church](church.md) and then 
citadel walls.

The cemetery lies on a higher ground than the [patium](patium.md).
Nothing much going on here - it's kind of a training ground
for the game.

Inside the [statue](statue.md), there is a small red gem 
with a interesting sparkle to it.
