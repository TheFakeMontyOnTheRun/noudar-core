Prison
======

A place where the seed bearers are kept their whole life,
in a futile attempt to prevent them to become the next 
demon master.

This place is *huge*! It contains the mausoleum on one
corner and the demon nest on the other. It's actually
split in two, with a small chasm dividing it up and 
locked gates, forcing you to shoot across the gap and
and go back up to the monastery to reach for the other
side.

From the first entrance, you reach the prison itself,
with all the cell closed.
