The Dungeons Of Noudar
======================

A turn based pure roguelike with very streamlined controls.

Written in C++14 and using TDD.

Main guidelines:

- Simple interactions
- Fully turn-based
- Deterministic behavior (so it is testable).
- Code is efficient while readable
- As plataform independent as possible (and thus, very portable)
