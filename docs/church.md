Cathedral
======

A quite imponent cathedral. It is comprised of two main 
chambers and two auxiliary chambers on the first floor and 
two smaller chambers on the second floor. One of the north 
chamber in the second floor also leads to the tower - the 
resting place for the mighty warrior, containing the 
[shield](shield.md).

The north chamber in the first floor is the altar, which 
recharges the shield of restoration. The south chamber (the 
first you seen as you enter) also has the 
[vitrals](vitrals.md) on the walls on the sides. It is 
comprised of many benches for sitting and praying, with a 
red carpet running thru the middle of it.

The east chamber on 1st floor takes you to 
[monastery](monastery.md), while the west serves as the end
for both stairwells for the 2nd floor north and south 
chambers.

On the 2nd floor, the south chamber has a passage from 
[pagan temple](nest.md), with exactly one clear shot path to
some ropes that hold the cloth covering the vitrals and
revealing the path to the [north tower](tower.md).

On the porches around the tower entrance, you get the only
clear shots into the ropes that hold the other vitrals covered
and that holds the tower entrance closed.
