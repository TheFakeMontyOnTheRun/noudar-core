Church
======

A quite imponent cathedral. It is comprised of two main chambers and two auxiliary chambers on the first floor and two smaller chambers on the second floor. One of the north chamber in the second floor also leads to the tower (which is not accessible after all).

The north chamber in the first floor is the altar, which recharges the shield of restoration. The south chamber (the first you seen as you enter) also has the vitrals on the walls on the sides. It is comprised of many benches for sitting and praying, with a red carpet running thru the middle of it.
