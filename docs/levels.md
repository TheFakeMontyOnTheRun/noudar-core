Levels
======
- Prologue

The player is an old crusader that used to be a priest. Since
he's capable of performing old rituals to purge demons back
to lower planes. Upon arrival on the citadel holding the
supposed victim, he discovers that he came too late. Now, he
must find the demon before it's too late.

- Level 1

[Patium](patium.md), [Church](church.md) halls.
[Cemetery](cemitery.md) is visible from outside. The left 
auxiliry chamber is not acessible (behind bars). The player
must proceed to the [Montastery](monastery.md) to find the
entrance to the cemetery.

In this level, the player has to fend off lot's of insane
monks

- Level 2

Inside the Monastery, the player must find the entrace to 
the dungeon. To do it so, he must cut 4 ropes that hold 
together the gate to the [Dungeons](prison.md). It is
overrun by [insane monks](monks.md).

Each rope is held inside a small altar, with the altars being
distributed across the field. 

- Level 3

At the dungeon, the player must find the entrance to the 
[mausoleum](mausoleum.md) and acquire the
[crossbow](crossbow.md).

At first, the cells of the dungeon will all be closed, but 
as you pass by, you realize that one of the cells has a small
passage hidden behind a pillar. You must cut a cord that 
holds all cells closed and kill all the [demons](demon.md).

Once inside the mausoleum, the player has to take the crossbow
and use it to cut a rope on the other side of a chasm. This
will open the passage that leads to the patium.

In this level, the player will battle lot's of fallen 
crusaders and finally the [warthog](warthog.md).

- Level 4

Back at the patium, at the monastery, the door to the 
dungeon is closed. Having the crossbow, the player can 
finally proceed to the cemetery. There, you player must fire
an arrow thru a window at the tower that faces the patium of
the citadel.

There, the player finally has access to the other side of 
the chasm and to the [nest](nest.md) at the pagan temple.

- Level 5

As the player finally encounters the cocoon inside the pagan 
temple, there is no other way out other than shooting it, 
causing the demon to wake up prematurely.

(The paintings on the mausoleum walls show that you're 
supposed to fight the demon with the crossbow anyway).

A great battle ensues, but the demon is weak and eventually
flees. 

- Level 6

The hero is weak, but eventually manages to come back
to the surface. On his way, we surfaces inside the cathedral
and to open the path, he must go to the 2nd floor of the it
and shoot a open holding a door in place. This rope also
holds the curtains over part of the vitrals. Revealing that
you must fetch the shield.

Time to get the shield!

- Level 7

The shield is on top of the resting place of a mighty 
warrior on a chamber on the 2nd floor, revealed when you cut
the rope on the cathedral. From behind the bars, you notice 
you must cut all other remaining ropes from the vitrals and 
reveal the whole story. After doing it so, the doors will 
open, allowing you to grab the shield.

- Level 8

One of the vitrals show that the battle must happen on the
patium, in front of the cathedral, due to the statue in the
middle having one of the magical stones.

Finally facing the [master demon](master-demon.md) in it's final form, the hero
must charge the shield inside the cathedral to finally slay
the beast.- Epilogue

The citadel crumbes as the demon, once again, sinks into the
underground for good. As a remainder of what happened, only
the walls survived such violent event. The hero, of course,
will have all eternity to suffer the wrath of the demon 
revenge.
