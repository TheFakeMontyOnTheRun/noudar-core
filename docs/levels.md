- Prologue

The player is an old crusader that used to be a priest. Since
he's capable of performing old rituals to purge demons back
to lower planes, he was asked to go to the [citadel](citadel.md)
to investigate some strange phenomena. Upon arrival, he 
discovers that he came too late. Now, he must find the demon
before it's powers reach it's peak.

- Chapter 1 (map0.txt)

[Patium](patium.md), [Church](church.md) halls.
[Cemetery](cemetery.md) is visible from outside. The left 
auxiliary chamber is not acessible (behind bars). The player
must find it's way to the [Monastery](monastery.md) to 
find the entrance to the [Dungeon](prison.md).

In this level, the player has to fend off lot's of 
[insane monks](monks.md).

- Chapter 2 (map1.txt)

Inside the Monastery, the player must find the entrace to 
the dungeon. To do it so, he must cut 4 ropes that hold 
together the gate to the Dungeons. This area is also 
overrun by insane monks.

Each rope is held inside a small altar, with the altars being
distributed across the praying rooms. 

- Chapter 3 (map2.txt)

At the dungeon, the player must find the entrance to the 
[mausoleum](mausoleum.md) and acquire the
[crossbow](crossbow.md).

At first, the cells of the dungeon will all be closed, but 
as you pass by, you realize that one of the cells has a small
passage hidden behind a pillar. You must cut a cord that 
holds all cells closed and kill all the 
[evil spirits](evil-spirit.md).

Once inside the mausoleum, the player has to take the 
crossbow and use it to cut a rope on the other side of a
chasm. This will open the passage that leads to the patium.

In this level, the player will battle lots of fallen 
crusaders and finally the [warthog](warthog.md).

- Chapter 4 (map3.txt)

Having the crossbow, the player can finally proceed to the 
cemetery. There, you player must fire an arrow thru a 
window at the tower that faces the patium of the citadel.

There, the player finally has access to the other side of 
the chasm and to the [nest](nest.md) at the pagan temple.

- Chapter 5 (map4.txt)

As the player finally encounters the cocoon inside the pagan 
temple, there is no other way out other than shooting it, 
causing the demon to wake up prematurely.

(The paintings on the mausoleum walls show that you're 
supposed to fight the demon with the crossbow anyway).

A great battle ensues, but the demon is weak and eventually
flees. 

- Chapter 6 (map5.txt)

The hero is weak, but eventually manages to come back
to the surface. On his way, we surfaces inside the cathedral
and to open the path, he must go to the 2nd floor of the it
and shoot a open holding a door in place. This rope also
holds the curtains over part of the vitrals. Revealing that
you must fetch the shield.

Time to get the shield!

The shield is on top of the resting place of a mighty 
warrior on a chamber on the 2nd floor, revealed when you cut
the rope on the cathedral. From behind the bars, you notice 
you must cut all other remaining ropes from the vitrals and 
reveal the whole story. After doing it so, the doors will 
open, allowing you to grab the shield.

- Chapter 7 (map6.txt)

One of the vitrals show that the battle must happen on the
patium, in front of the cathedral, due to the statue in the
middle having one of the magical stones. To lure the beast,
you must break the statue.

Finally facing the [master demon](master-demon.md) in it's
final form, the hero must charge the shield inside the 
cathedral to kill the demon for good. Otherwise, his shots
would cause no harm to the demon.

- Epilogue

The citadel crumbles as the demon, once again, sinks into the
underground for good. As a remainder of what happened, only
the walls survived such violent event. The hero, of course,
will have all eternity to suffer the wrath of the demon's 
revenge.
