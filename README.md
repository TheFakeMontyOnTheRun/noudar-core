# Dungeons of Noudar - core
This is the roguelike core for Dungeons of Noudar. It also contains the unit tests to ensure gameplay is as intended.

It depends on ncurses-dev (Ubuntu) and clang3.8 (uses gcc for code coverage report generation)

On MS-DOS (that's right!), all it depends on is CWSDPMI.exe
