After such gruesome and soulsearching
battle, you did it - the demon was
history.

But wait...as soon as you defeated the
demon and it swore to come back for
your soul, the ground began to rumble.
A split second later, the ground
beneath you simply collapsed into a big
amorphous mass of land.

As you finally find peace and
redemption, you will also embrace
eternity.

Thank you for playing.
